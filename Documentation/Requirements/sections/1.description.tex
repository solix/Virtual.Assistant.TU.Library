This project entails the implementation of a prototype of a ``Virtual Assistant'' that helps students write a scientific publication.
It allows the student to schedule his/her progress and deadlines, collaborate with others, and receive feedback from either
a peer or a superior. The ``Virtual Assistant'' will provide the student with several templates from which he or she can choose.

The purpose of this project is to provide guidance and support through an online environment for students who are
writing a scientific publication. This guidance comes in the form of scheduling, peer-to-peer feedback, tracking activity and 
making suggestions and recommendations based on these. The scope is the writing of a report based on any of the predefined templates that 
the environment will provide.
