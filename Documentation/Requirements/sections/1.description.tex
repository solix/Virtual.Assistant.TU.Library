This project entails the implementation of a prototype of a ``Virtual Assistant'' that helps students write a scientific publication.
The ``Virtual Assistant'' will come in the form of an online environment that will allow the student to schedule his/her progress 
and deadlines, collaborate with others, and receive feedback from either a peer or a superior. 
It will provide the student with several templates from which he or she can choose, as well as information and knowledge
about how to write a scientific publication by using the TULib database.

The purpose of this project is to provide guidance and support through an online environment for students who are
writing a scientific publication. This guidance comes in the form of scheduling, peer-to-peer feedback, tracking activity and 
making suggestions and recommendations based on these. The scope is the writing of a report based on any of the predefined templates that 
the environment will provide.
