This project entails the implementation of a prototype of a ``Virtual Assistant'' that helps students write a scientific publication.
The ``Virtual Assistant'' will come in the form of an online environment that will allow the student to schedule his/her progress 
and deadlines, collaborate with others, and receive feedback from either a peer or a superior. 
It will provide the student with at least two predefined templates from which he or she can choose, as well as information and knowledge
about how to write a scientific publication by using the TULib database. It will track the students activity
and give suggestions and recommendations based on the schedule, template and feedback.
