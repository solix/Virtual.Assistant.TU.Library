\chapter{Introduction}

When students and researchers want to write an article, thesis or dissertation, It is not as overwhelming as it sounds. They are encountering many problems in organizing and writing their paper because they fail to find information on how to write their paper properly and have difficulty to make nice planning for their article. They also encounter obstacle on collaborating with others and bringing everyone in one place. \\

Fundamentally completing a research, article or dissertation paper takes right effort, effective collaboration and proper planning. This problem has been pointed out by research and development team of TU Delft library. R \& D team has come up with idea that in order to help researchers and students to avoid major obstacles on writing their paper, they need to have some sort of virtual assistant to guide them throughout their process of writing an article.\\

`AssistU' web application is a prototype  that is developed to target this problem and attempted to reflect above mentioned idea in more concrete way. It is the first step taken to facilitate students in writing their scientific article correctly without any hassle by providing all the tools needed.\\ 

In this document, detailed information about `AssistU' project is given. Second chapter indicates the research that is conducted to set up the project and explains tools and choices that are made to reach an optimal solution for the present problem. Chapter three will guide the reader through design and structure of the application. Features of the application is explained on chapter four. Finally on the last chapters of this document facts, obstacles and recommendations followed by conclusion is explained.
