\chapter{Introduction}

The TU Delft Library is an innovative library that is always looking for a creative solution for the future. They proposed us with a project that is intended to help students and researchers to write a scientific publication. The project entails a software environment in which they are able to plan their process of writing using a calendar, to get suggestions about how to correctly write a scientific publication, and where they can get and give feedback on (un)finished work.\\\\
