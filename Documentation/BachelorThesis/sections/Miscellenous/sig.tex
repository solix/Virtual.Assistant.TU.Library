\subsubsection{SIG feedback} % (fold)
Software Improvement Group(SIG) has given constructive feedbacks about maintenance and quality of this application and helped development team to improve the code in general. The project's code has been submitted at two stages: Mid-review and final review.\\

By the end of the sixth week(middle phase of the project), SIG have released their feedback about the code. They have stated that the code have achieved score of 4 starts in their maintenance model, which is above average. The reason that the code did not achieve full score (5 star) was due component imbalance, duplication and unit size. There were also few comments on unclarity of components structure in the file system that made it difficult for other developers(developers in outside world) to have a high level understanding of the application architecture.\\

Before the second submission, The development team has improved the code according to SIG's feedback. The main challenge was when improving, number of code, files, components was growing simultaneously. By that time, the main consideration for the development team was to develop a quality software. Applying SIG's feedback has helped developers to keep an application maintained, and improved code quality.\\
 
One of the developers concern was to increase the code test coverage, which was massively increased to 70\%. Developers in the team kept the unit size small where possible and avoid duplication of code, however this was not possible in some places. AT the time of final submission to SIG, changes where made but the score could not be improved compare to previous submission due to long unit size at some places. The main reason causing this was limited time and sharp deadlines which made developers change their focus on implementing features that functions properly rather than code clean up and testing. Moreover API's where employed locally and those were not written by the development team but included as a part of the file system. On the other side, most of the duplication were removed and test coverage has been increased and file structure were re-factored to give more clear overview of an MVC architecture.\\
