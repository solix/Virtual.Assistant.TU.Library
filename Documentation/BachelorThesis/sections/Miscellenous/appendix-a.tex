\textbf{Description: \\}
 Researchers confront lots of hurdles when they want to plan and write an article. The problem is pointed out by TU Delft library R \& D group. They came up with an idea of having a virtual assistant that guide researchers throughout their project. The research has been done on possible solution to tackle this problem. During the research phase we analyzed various tools and brainstorm on best available options and optimum solutions. The criteria was obviously time vs. quality due to 12 weeks project life cycle. Finally choices were made based on fast prototyping because the client(TU Library) needed a way to prove their concept. Scrum has helped to achieve proper planning and to define detail description of feature. There were no major problem related to the main features that is reported as unresolved during the project life cycle. However certain additional features has been left out for future version due to time limitation.\\
