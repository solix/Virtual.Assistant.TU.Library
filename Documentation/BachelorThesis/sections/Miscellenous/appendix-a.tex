\section{Description: }
 Researchers tackles lots of hurdles when they want to plan and write an article. The problem is pointed out by TU Delft library R \& D group. They came up with an idea of having a virtual assistant that guide researchers throughout their project. The research has been done on possible solution to tackle this problem. During the research phase we analyzed various tools and brainstorm on best available options. The criteria was obviously time vs. quality due to 12 weeks project life cycle. Finally choices were made upon fast prototyping because the client needed a way to prove their concept. Scrum has helped to achieve proper planning and detail description. Complete project planning and product backlog has been created.
