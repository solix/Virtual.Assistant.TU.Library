Every project is an opportunity for developers to practice their technical and interpersonal knowledge they have acquired and it gives them chance to strengthen them. In the other hand there are flaws that can occur in the scope of every project. In the beginning phase, when the developers wanted to design the features for the virtual assistant application, they were ambitiously willing to take in so many features for 14 weeks time. The reason is identified by development team due to being naive to envision the feasibility of the project in given time line. The good parts of this project has compensated the aforementioned flaw. The amazing teamwork with the development team and client gave the development team a great experience working in a business environment. Moreover the final prototype has met client wishes and functional requirement as expected. The lesson learned for the developers is that it is very good to be an ambitious programmer but It is important to do the planning more realistically.
