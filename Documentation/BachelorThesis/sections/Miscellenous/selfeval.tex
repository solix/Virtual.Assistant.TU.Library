Every project is an opportunity for developers to practice their technical and interpersonal skills, and also strengthen them. However, most projects also encounter certain mistakes which can occur during the execution of the project. For instance, when initially choosing which features to design for the virtual assistant application, our ambition caused us to take in too many features to implement in only 14 weeks time. The reason for this is that we were too naive, and let our enthousiasm cloud our judgement in terms of feasibility within the given time line. However, certain things also went well which allowed us to compensate for the aforementioned flaw. The collaboration between us and the client resulted in a great experience for us in terms of working in a business environment. Moreover, the final prototype has met the client's wishes and functional requirements as expected. The main lesson learned here is that it's very good to be an ambitious programmer, but not if it gets in the way of realistic planning.
