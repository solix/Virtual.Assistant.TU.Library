\chapter{Conclusion}

During the past fourteen weeks the AssisTU application has grown from a rough idea into a basic implementation that can be used to build upon in the 
future. It started off with an intensive research phase, where all possible angles, frameworks and implementation strategies were compared with each
other in order to be able to set out the planning. Keeping in mind all the required features, an architecture was designed in the form of the 
commonly used Model-View-Controller appoach.
