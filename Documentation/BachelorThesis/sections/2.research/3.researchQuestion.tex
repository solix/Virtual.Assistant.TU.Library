The context of this project is to build an application that acts as a virtual assistant to help Bachelor students write their article/report in a correct manner. In order to design a robust and reliable software application, we first need to formulate a research question to do the technical research and to come up with a feasible and optimal solution for developing a prototype application.\\\\

During the first meeting that involved both our client and coach, the latter has persuaded us to develop a web application. Throughout the rest of this research report we will primarily assume that a web application is most likely the best choice of platform, whereas the research itself is intended to find out whether this assumption is correct, and if so, why it would be an ideal choice. \\\\

The main research question is formulated as follows: `How do we build a reliable and robust web application prototype that is able to assist students in writing an article or report, and is also able to guide them in such a way that they are able to write an article or report in a correct and effici\"ent manner within the time constraint that is given to them?
