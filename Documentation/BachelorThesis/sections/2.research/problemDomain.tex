Within the following section we will describe and analyse what our problem domain is, identify the stakeholders, construct the scope and objectives, and summarize the interviews conducted from the relevant stakeholders.

\subsection{Domain Description} % (fold)
\label{sub:problem_description}

The goal of this project is the creation and implementation of a prototype for a `Virtual Assistant', which helps students and researchers to write a report, thesis or dissertation. This Virtual Assistant should provide its users with the ability to choose a layout template, allow for scheduling and feedback, and give suggestions or tips to users about how to write a report, thesis or dissertation.
This project should entail either native desktop software, a web application, or a mobile application. The final product should be released as open source software.

\subsection{Domain analysis} % (fold)

One of the key aspects that needs to be well-researched for our project is our domain analysis. The domain analysis basically illustrates all the different types of roles involved with the problem domain (i.e. the stakeholders), and what their interests are. First we list all the stakeholders involved with our domain, secondly we define our scope, and finally we summarize a set of interviews we have conducted with people that embody relevant roles.

\subsubsection{Stakeholders} % (fold)

Below we identify the different stakeholders, which roles they can take, and what their main interests are within our problem domain.

\paragraph{Client/Project Owner: TU Delft Library} The TU Delft Library is the entity that requested this project, and is therefor our client. They expect a prototype of a product that meets their requirements.

\paragraph{Users: Students and Researchers} The use of this product is aimed at students, and researchers, which makes them a subset of our users. They want a product that is easy to use and helps them with writing a report/thesis/dissertation.

\paragraph{Users: Reviewers} The use of this product is also aimed at reviewers. Reviewrs can be teachers, supervisors, coaches, editors and/or peers which makes the complementary subset of our users. They also want a product that is easy to use and facilitates them in reviewing a report/thesis/dissertation.

\paragraph{Contributors: Open Source Developers} Our client requested that our final version be released as an open source project. This means that at some point in the future other developers are going to improve upon our product. With this in mind, we have to introduce some design ideals and constraints that will make it easier for them to add code in the future.

\subsubsection{Scope \& Objectives}

The scope of our domain is set for the use-case of students who are writing a Bachelor project final report. One obvious reason for this scope is that this project is also a Bachelor final project, which will also include the process of writing a final report. This means that we will have affinity with the scope, which should imply an advantage within our design. Another reason is that there are plainly too many different cases and subjects within our problem domain to serve all of them accordingly within our deadline.
Our main objective is the creation of an online environment that acts as a support for students who are writing a report/thesis/dissertation. It should provide the students with suggestions, tips, sources and other relevant information. It should provide a platform where there is an interaction between students and their peers or superiors (in this case a teacher, coach or supervisor), and where they can exchange feedback towards each other.

\subsubsection{Interview result analysis} % (fold)

Three interviews were conducted. The first one was conducted from Accel Abarca, a student at the TU Delft EWI Faculty, the second one from Poorya Pahlevan, a reviewer working at TNO, and the final one from Nicole Will, the head of Education Support at the TU Delft Library.
These interviews allowed us to gain more insight into how the features should be implemented, and what our priorities should be. We learned that communication and collaboration are the foremost important issues the interviewees expected us to handle. Apart from these, also easy access and planning were mentioned as useful features to have. The interviews gave us some insights in certain expectations, which in turn allowed us to formulate a research question, which will be handled in the following section. \\

A summary of each interview can be found in Appendix section Appendix B.
