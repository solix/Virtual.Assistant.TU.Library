Throughout this report we have first analyzed our problem domain to gain more insight into the domain itself. Secondly we listed the functional requirements, technical requirements and usability requirements. Based on these requirements and problem domain we formulated a research question that would define our research objectives. Finally we have researched which design patterns and conventions would be appropriate to deliver an optimal solution for the problem domain.\\\\
We chose the MVC model as the designing pattern so that components of the system are grouped in such a way that it keeps the convention of having high cohesion and low coupling. This will help alot for future extensions of features. We chose the Play!Framework so we would be able to use our knowledge in Java and Scala, and which would allow us to practice Object Oriented Programming as well as Functional Programming. The combination of our technical choices and research findings should enable us to deliver fast, reliable and robust software that can act as a virtual assistant for students.
