\setheader{Preface}

This thesis is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science \& Engineering at University of Delft. 
The project ran from November 2014 to March 2015.\\

We would like to thank the Research and Development department of the Delft University Library, especially Mr. Babak DehghenPour, Mrs. Nicoleta Nastase 
and Mrs. Karin Clavel who offered us this project. They have provided us with lots of trust and flexibility for this project and it was an amazing 
experience for us working with them.\\

I would also like to thank our coach, Mr. Alberto Bacchelli, for having given us not only lots of detailed instructions, but also having taught us many
useful practical tips whilst performing the project.\\

This thesis project has been very challenging, but during the process we felt that we have learned a lot. We have dealt with many different subjects 
during the creation of a proof of concept for the idea which had been proposed for this project.
