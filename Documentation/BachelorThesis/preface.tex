This thesis is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirement for  the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science \& Engineering at University of Delft. The work is done from November 2014 to March 2015.\\

We would like to thank Research and Development team, Mr.Babak DehghanPour, Mrs.Nicoleta Nastase and Mrs.Karin Clavel from TU Delft library who offered us this project. They have showed lots of trust and flexibility for this project and It was such an amazing experience for us working with them.\\

I would also like to thank our coach, Mr.ALberto Bacchelli. He gave us not only lots of detailed instruction but also showed us many useful practical tips on conducting the project.\\

Doing the thesis project has been very challenging but during the process we felt that we have learned a lot. We have been dealing with lots of subjects and attempted to give a proof of concept for the idea which has been proposed for this project.
