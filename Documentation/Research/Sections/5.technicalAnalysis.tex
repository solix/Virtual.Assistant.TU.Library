When conducting the research for the problem domain, We have extracted information regarding stakeholders and scope of the project. In this section we will justify our findings on technical choices regarding the deployment of the tools, design and system components. These choices are based on the requirement that is given by the product owner and the extra requirement that we think is necessary for developing a robust software.   

\subsection{Why web application?}
Nowadays people rely heavily on using the web application. Google maps are good example of such an application, It is a very powerful software that provides to the user so many map features within a web browser, users can travel virtually within a map and can zoom for particular locations. Every time a user asks for specific information, that information is pulled dynamically into the web app.\\
 For our purpose web application is the best choice because users can access their data from various locations on any device because all data is stored online and it works on every device with a web browser. It is also safer to run an application on a web browser because It cannot interfere with programs running on the user's computer and this will lead to better performance of the machine.

\subsection{Objectives}
We have set number of objectives to develop of robust, fast and reliable web app:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Client rich interaction}
	\item \textbf{Full stack framework}
	\item \textbf{Scalability}
	\item \textbf{Fast Prototyping}
	\item \textbf{Proven in Production}
	\item \textbf{Reliable}
	\item \textbf{high speed database lookup capabilities}
	\item \textbf{generally applicable}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Project Development Process} % (fold)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item using Scrum Agile method
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Sprint : weekly
		\item Sprint reflections
		\item Product backlog planning
		\item sprint backlog
		\item ....
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Technical Components}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item User(Client) interaction with web(Asynchrous vs sync)
	\item Distributed application structure(clien/server)
	\item Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
	\item Build systems
	\item Databases(need more research)
	\item Continous Integration
\end{enumerate}
