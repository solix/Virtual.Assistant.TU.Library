The context of this project is to build an application that acts as an virtual assistant to help bachelor students to write their article/report in the correct manner. In order to design a robust and reliable software we need to formulate a research question to do the technical research and to come up with feasible and optimal solution for developing an application prototype.\\

Our coach has advised us to develop a web application, We will assume that this is a good choice of platform, however we will conduct research to find out why is this an ideal choice. \\

Our main question is `How to build a reliable \& robust web application prototype to assist students in order to deliver services to them such that they are able to write an article/report in a correct and efficient manner within the time constraint that is given to them? '
