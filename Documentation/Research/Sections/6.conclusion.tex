Throughout this report we have first analysed our problem domain to gain more insight into the domain. Secondly we listed the functional requirements, technical requirements and usability requirements. Based on these requirements and problem domain we formulated a research question that would define our research objectives. Finally we have reserached on choosing design patterns and convention for ourselves to deliver an optimal solution for the problem domain.\\\\
MVC model is chosen as design pattern so that components of the system grouped in such a way that has high cohesion and low coupling this will help alot for extension of features. By chosing Play!Framework we are able to use our knowledge in Java and Scala, This enable us to practice Object Oriented Programming as well as Functional programming in this project. We believe by using the finding that we have gained during research phase we can deliver fast,reliable and robust software that acts as an virtual assistant for students.
