The TU Delft Library is an innovative library that is always looking for a creative solution for the future. They proposed us with a project that is intended to help students and researchers to write a scientific publication. The project entails a software environment in which they are able to plan their process of writing in a calendar, to get suggestions about how to correctly write a scientific publication, and where they can get and give feedback on (un)finished work.
The outline of this research report is as follows: First we explain the problem domain, and provide an analysis. Secondly we state our project's requirements. Based on these requirements we propose a research question that embodies our main objectives, followed by a technical analysis. The final part of this research report provides us with the optimal solution for our problem.
